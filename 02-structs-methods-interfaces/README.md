# Task 2: Structs, Methods, Receivers & Interfaces - Library Management System

## Concepts Covered
- Defining structs with multiple fields
- Value receivers vs pointer receivers
- Methods attached to types
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Type assertions
- Composition

## What I'm Building
A library management system that tracks books, members, and borrowing operations using structs, methods, and interfaces.

## Features
- Add books and members to library
- Borrow and return books
- Track which member has which book
- Enforce borrowing rules (max 3 books per member)
- List available books
- Display member information
- Use interfaces for polymorphic behavior
